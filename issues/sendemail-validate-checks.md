# Add Validation Checks for sendemail-validate Hook

The sample hook `.git/hooks/sendemail-validate.sample` contains placeholders
for additional validation logic. Implement custom checks for cover letters,
patches and entire series (e.g. spell checking and code style). The original
placeholder comments have been removed and recorded here.
