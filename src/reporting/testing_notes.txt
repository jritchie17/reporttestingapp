Once it was confirmed that all cube logic adhered to appropriate standards, the finalized report was passed to Amsurg QA for formal validation testing. All values presented in this report were validated against the predefined cube logic specifications to ensure complete alignment with internal financial data. Testing focused exclusively on verifying the data transformations and monthly aggregations. Each CASE transformation and filter—such as the inclusion of CenterNumber = '1001-001' only for specific CAReportNames—was confirmed and executed in order to match cube logic rules. No downstream assumptions or external adjustments were made; all calculations (e.g., YTD, QTD, variance, and YOY comparisons) were strictly derived from cube-prescribed logic using exact financial month alignment. This ensures that all reported figures are cube-faithful, audit-ready, and aligned with internal database financial data. Any changes to logic in the Cognos Cube will require revalidation by Amsurg QA.
