All values presented in this report were rigorously validated against predefined cube logic specifications to ensure complete alignment with internal financial reporting standards. Testing focused exclusively on verifying the data transformations, center exclusions, CAReportName mappings, and monthly aggregations derived from data available in the ODS and validated against SmartStream values. Each CASE transformation and filter—such as the inclusion of CenterNumber = '1001-001' only for specific CAReportNames—was confirmed to match cube logic rules. No downstream assumptions or external adjustments were made; all calculations (e.g., YTD, QTD, variance, and YOY comparisons) were strictly derived from cube-prescribed logic using exact financial month alignment. Once internal validation confirmed that all metrics adhered to these standards, the finalized outputs were prepared and passed to Amsurg QA for formal acceptance testing. This ensures that all reported figures are cube-faithful, audit-ready, and aligned with enterprise financial governance.
